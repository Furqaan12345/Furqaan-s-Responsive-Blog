                <p class="text-muted text-left">Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park. Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Taj Mahal lit. 'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>

                <p>Being one of the greatest, most memorable and iconic Disney movies, everyone expected nothing less than greatness from this movie and greatness is what they got. Directing movies like Iron Man and Jungle Book, and directing a series like The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau was definitely one of the reasons this movie was as big of a hit as it was. The incredible emotion and portrayal of these characters that was conveyed in this movie was immensely powerful and moved a lot of people. The Lion King was always one of the most popular Disney movies ever, and with the edition of this new movie, the popularity of this movie was very large. The Lion King was full of heart and compassion while still having a lot of action and great story telling. The way this movie expressed the good of people and the heart of culture and society today had a big positive effect on people.</p>

                    Renewables grew almost 5 per cent per year between 2009 and 2019, outpacing fossil fuels at 1.7 per cent.
                    Although most new renewable energy capacity installations have been made in developing countries in the last two years, developed countries had around four times more capacity per capita than developing countries in 2019.
                    In 2018, the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption amounted to 17.1 per cent, with the largest increase in the share of renewables for electricity. The transport and heating sectors show much slower or no progress.
                    More than 80 per cent of all new electricity capacity added in 2020 was renewable with solar and wind accounting for 91 per cent. Investment in offshore wind hit its highest level ever at $29.9 billion.
                    In 2018, international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy amounted to $14 billion, a 35 per cent decrease from an all-time high of $21.9 billion in 201</p>

We are not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

                    2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record.
                    On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature is expected to increase by 3-5°C by the end of the century.
                    In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Carbon dioxide levels were 148 per cent of preindustrial levels.
                    Greenhouse gas concentrations, already at their highest levels in 3 million years, have continued to rise.
                    Since the mid-1980s, Arctic surface air temperatures have warmed at least twice as fast as the global average, while sea ice, the Greenland ice sheet and glaciers have declined over the same period and permafrost temperatures have increased.

Set in Middle-earth, a place like Earth at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. <br>

As the author details in the first chapter, it is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. The novel is remarkable not only for its huge cast of characters and psychological scope, but also for its precise and detailed observation of the life and social structures typical of 18th-century Chinese society. It contains within its pages a sampling of all of the major modes of the Chinese literary tradition.<br>

He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical monologues on knighthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story.<br>
